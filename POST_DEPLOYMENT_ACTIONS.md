# üöÄ Post-Deployment Action Plan

## ‚úÖ Deployment Successful! Now What?

### üìç Step 1: Get Your Railway URL

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your deployed service
3. Find your deployment URL (looks like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
4. Save this URL - you'll need it for testing and integration

---

## üß™ Step 2: Test Your Live Endpoints

### A. Test Basic Health Check
Open your browser and visit:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T..."
}
```

### B. Test Emergency Services (No DB Required)
Use a tool like Postman, curl, or even your browser's console:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/search/emergency

# Using PowerShell (since you're on Windows)
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-app.railway.app/search/emergency" -Method POST
```

### C. Test Main Search Endpoint
```bash
# PowerShell example
$body = @{
    message = "I need medical help"
    limit = 3
    language = "English"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-app.railway.app/search" `
    -Method POST `
    -Body $body `
    -ContentType "application/json"
```

## üîó Step 3: Set Up Qdrant Database

Since your API is running, you now need to connect it to a Qdrant database:

### Option A: Use Qdrant Cloud (Recommended for Production)

1. **Sign up at [cloud.qdrant.io](https://cloud.qdrant.io)**
2. **Create a free cluster**
3. **Get your credentials:**
   - Host URL (e.g., `xxx.us-east-1-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io`)
   - API Key
   - Port (usually 6333)

4. **Add to Railway Environment Variables:**
   ```
   QDRANT_HOST=xxx.us-east-1-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io
   QDRANT_PORT=6333
   QDRANT_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

### Option B: Use Local Qdrant (For Development)

1. **Install Docker Desktop** (if not already installed)
2. **Run Qdrant locally:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
   ```
3. **Use ngrok to expose it** (for testing):
   ```bash
   ngrok http 6333
   ```
4. **Update Railway with ngrok URL**

---

## üìä Step 4: Populate Your Database

Once Qdrant is connected, populate it with refugee service data:

### Run the Data Population Script
```bash
# First, ensure your .env file has the Qdrant credentials
# Then run:
python populate_database.py
```

This will:
- Create the collection in Qdrant
- Load all refugee services from CSV
- Generate embeddings
- Store everything in the vector database

---

## üéØ Step 5: Integrate with Voiceflow

Now that your API is live, integrate it with Voiceflow:

### A. In Voiceflow:

1. **Create a new API Integration Block**
2. **Set the endpoint:**
   ```
   URL: https://your-app.railway.app/search
   Method: POST
   ```

3. **Configure the request body:**
   ```json
   {
     "message": "{user_query}",
     "limit": 5,
     "language": "{user_language}"
   }
   ```

4. **Map the response:**
   - Save `resources` array to a variable
   - Display results in a carousel or list

### B. Create Conversation Flows:

1. **Emergency Flow:**
   - Trigger words: "emergency", "urgent", "help now"
   - API endpoint: `/search/emergency`
   - Show critical contacts immediately

2. **Service Search Flow:**
   - Capture user query
   - Call `/search` endpoint
   - Display results with contact info

3. **Language Support Flow:**
   - Detect user language preference
   - Pass language parameter to API
   - Show language-specific services

---

## üìà Step 6: Monitor Your Deployment

### A. Check Railway Metrics
- Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Metrics
- Monitor:
  - Request count
  - Response times
  - Error rates
  - Memory usage

### B. View Logs
```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway logs

# Or in Railway dashboard
Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Logs
```

### C. Set Up Alerts (Optional)
- Configure alerts for errors or high response times
- Add webhook notifications to Slack/Discord

---

## üß™ Step 7: Test Complete User Journey

### Test Script for Full Functionality:
```python
import requests
import json

# Your Railway URL
BASE_URL = "https://your-app.railway.app"

# Test 1: Health Check
print("Testing health check...")
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/health")
print(f"Health: {response.json()}")

# Test 2: Emergency Services
print("\nTesting emergency services...")
response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/search/emergency")
print(f"Emergency services count: {len(response.json()['resources'])}")

# Test 3: Regular Search
print("\nTesting search...")
search_data = {
    "message": "I need help with housing",
    "limit": 3
}
response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/search", json=search_data)
result = response.json()
print(f"Found {len(result['resources'])} services")
for resource in result['resources']:
    print(f"  - {resource.get('name', 'Unknown')}")

print("\n‚úÖ All tests completed!")
```

## üö¶ Step 8: Go Live Checklist

### Before Public Launch:

- [ ] **Database populated** with all service data
- [ ] **Test all endpoints** with real queries
- [ ] **Voiceflow integration** tested end-to-end
- [ ] **Error handling** verified (try bad requests)
- [ ] **Response times** are acceptable (<2 seconds)
- [ ] **CORS settings** configured for your domain
- [ ] **Rate limiting** configured (if needed)

## üéä Step 9: Announce Your Service!

Your refugee support API is now live! Consider:

1. **Share with stakeholders**
   - Send API documentation link: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs`
   - Provide test credentials if auth is enabled

2. **Create user documentation**
   - How to search for services
   - Available languages
   - Emergency contact info

3. **Gather feedback**
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Collect user feedback
   - Iterate and improve

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Search Returns No Results:
1. Check if database is populated: `https://your-app.railway.app/health/detailed`
2. Verify Qdrant connection in Railway logs
3. Run `populate_database.py` to add data

### If Response is Slow:
1. Check Railway metrics for performance
2. Consider upgrading Railway plan
3. Enable caching in the application

### If Getting Errors:
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test with the validation script
