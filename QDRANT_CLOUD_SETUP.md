2. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"**
3. Sign up using:
   - GitHub (recommended for developers)
   - Google
   - Or email/password

### 1.2 Verify Your Email
- Check your email for verification link
- Click to verify your account

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Cluster

### 2.1 Create Free Cluster
1. Once logged in, click **"Create Cluster"** or **"+ New Cluster"**
2. Choose the **Free Tier** (1GB RAM, 0.5 vCPU)
   - Perfect for your refugee support project
   - No credit card required
3. Select options:
   - **Cluster Name**: `act-refugee-support` (or your preference)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users (e.g., `us-east-1` or `ap-southeast-2` for Australia)
   - **Version**: Use latest (default)

### 2.2 Wait for Provisioning
- Takes about 30-60 seconds
- You'll see a progress indicator
- Status will change from "Creating" to "Running"

---

## Step 3: Get Your Connection Details

### 3.1 Access Cluster Dashboard
1. Click on your cluster name once it's running
2. You'll see the cluster details page

### 3.2 Copy Your Credentials
Look for these important details:

**Cluster URL:**
```
https://YOUR-CLUSTER-ID.us-east-1-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io
```
(This is your QDRANT_HOST - copy the full URL)

**Port:**
```
6333
```
(Usually 6333 for HTTPS connections)

### 3.3 Generate API Key
1. In cluster dashboard, click **"API Keys"** tab
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Give it a name: `railway-api-key`
4. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the API key immediately (shown only once!)
5. Save it somewhere secure

Your credentials will look like:
```
QDRANT_HOST=abc123xyz.us-east-1-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io
QDRANT_PORT=6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=YOUR_LONG_API_KEY_HERE
```

---

## Step 4: Add Credentials to Railway

### 4.1 Open Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your deployed service
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab

### 4.2 Add Environment Variables
Add these three variables:

```bash
QDRANT_HOST=YOUR-CLUSTER-ID.us-east-1-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io
QDRANT_PORT=6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: 
- Do NOT include `https://` in QDRANT_HOST
- Just use the domain: `xxx.us-east-1-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io`

### 4.3 Deploy Changes
- Railway will automatically redeploy when you add variables
- Wait for the deployment to complete (green checkmark)

---

## Step 5: Update Local .env File

Create/update your local `.env` file for testing:

```env
# Qdrant Cloud Configuration
QDRANT_HOST=YOUR-CLUSTER-ID.us-east-1-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io
QDRANT_PORT=6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# OpenAI Configuration (if not already set)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Other settings
USE_LIGHTWEIGHT=true
```

---

## Step 6: Test Connection

Run this test script to verify connection:

```python
python test_qdrant_connection.py
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Connected to Qdrant Cloud successfully!
‚úÖ Cluster is healthy
Collections: []  # Empty initially
```

---

## Step 7: Populate Your Database

Now populate with refugee service data:

```bash
python populate_qdrant_cloud.py
```

This will:
1. Create the collection
2. Generate embeddings for all services
3. Upload to Qdrant Cloud
4. Verify the data

Expected output:
```
Creating collection: act_refugee_resources
Loading data from CSV...
Generating embeddings...
Uploading to Qdrant Cloud...
‚úÖ Successfully uploaded 300+ services
```

---

## Step 8: Verify Everything Works

### 8.1 Test Your Live API
```bash
python test_live_api.py
```

Now search should return real results!

### 8.2 Check Qdrant Dashboard
1. In Qdrant Cloud dashboard, click your cluster
2. Go to **"Collections"** tab
3. You should see `act_refugee_resources` with point count

### 8.3 Test a Real Search
```powershell
$body = @{
    message = "medical services in Canberra"
    limit = 3
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/search" `
    -Method POST `
    -Body $body `
    -ContentType "application/json"
```
